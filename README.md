## Naming conventions
- Content types and Single Types should all be capitalized e.g. Evaluation
- fields should all be lowercase e.g. title
- Content Type display name should be written as close to the english language as possible
- Content types that are filled with Master Data (data received from a third party, not under our control e.g. AVV entries) should be prefixed with the letters "MD" e.g. MD Matrix
- Enumeration entries should all be uppercase e.g. HUHN


## Configuration conventions
- All Master Data Content types should have the 'Draft & Publish' feature disabled.
